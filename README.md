# AnpanSwap Subgraph

TheGraph exposes a GraphQL endpoint to query the events and entities within the Binance Smart Chain and AnpanSwap ecosystem.

Currently, there are multiple subgraphs, but additional subgraphs can be added to this repo:

1. **[Blocks](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/anpanswap/blocks)**: Tracks all blocks on Binance Smart Chain.

2. **[Pairs](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/anpanswap/pairs)**: Tracks all AnpanSwap Pairs and Tokens.

3. **[Exchange](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/anpanswap/exchange)**: Tracks all AnpanSwap Exchange data with price, volume, liquidity, ...

4. **[Profile](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/anpanswap/profile)**: Tracks all AnpanSwap Profile with teams, users, points and campaign.

5. **[Timelock](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/anpanswap/timelock)**: Tracks all timelock transactions queued, executed, and cancelled.

6. **[Trading Competition v1](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/anpanswap/trading-competition-v1)**: Tracks all metrics for the Easter Battle (April 07â€”14, 2021).


## To setup and deploy

For any of the subgraph: `blocks` as `[subgraph]`

1. Run the `yarn run codegen:[subgraph]` command to prepare the TypeScript sources for the GraphQL (generated/*).

2. Run the `yarn run build:[subgraph]` command to build the subgraph, and check compilation errors before deploying.

3. Run `graph auth https://api.thegraph.com/deploy/ '<ACCESS_TOKEN>'`

4. Deploy via `yarn run deploy:[subgraph]`.
